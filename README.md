# BannerlordSettlementPatcher
A library to load custom settlements into the game without needing to manually modify the sandbox module. Loads the submodule.xml and checks for any entries with id prefabs or settlements, then proceeds to insert them into the sandbox module settlements.xml and main_map/scene.xscene files. Creates a backup and makes sure to restore the file to vanilla when the game ends. If it crashes, it will restore the file upon restart. If the game is updated by Taleworlds it will detect it and use the new settlements.xml and/or main_map/scene.xscene files making this method patch proof.
